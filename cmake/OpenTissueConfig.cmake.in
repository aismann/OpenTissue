# Try to find OpenTissue, runtime libraries, and include paths.
# Once done this will define
#
# OPENTISSUE_FOUND        : System has OpenTissue and it can be used.
# OPENTISSUE_INCLUDE_DIRS : Directories need to find header-files used by OpenTissue and OpenTissue itself
# OPENTISSUE_LIBRARY_DIRS : Directories where the compiler can find static libraries of third-party software used by OpenTissue.
# OPENTISSUE_LIBS         : Full paths to all libraries of third-party software used by OpenTissue.
# OPENTISSUE_FLAGS        : OpenTissue compiler flags that should be used for any application using OpenTissue.
#
# Boost_unit_test_framework_LIBRARY : OpenTissue uses the Boost unit-test framework. This tells where the libs are for the linker
