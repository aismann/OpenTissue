# Using OpenTissue in your Application
OpenTissue is a header only library consisting of a collection of many smaller sub-libraries. In your application you might want to use one of these libraries or several in combination with each other. Very much in the same way as you would use libraries like STL or Boost in an application.

Many of these sub-libraries are self-contained, that is, they do not have explicit third-party dependencies. Thus, in order to use OpenTissue in your application you need to tell your compiler the location of the OpenTissue include headers which is usually accomplished by passing the flag (Linux,MacOS) ```-I <path-to-opentissue>/``` at the comand line. On the other hand, if you are using any sub-libraries that have some dependency then your application will have the same dependency. For instance, a substantial subset of the libraries use Boost, so in these cases your application will depend on Boost as well.

If you use OpenTissue CMake/Conan based build system generation and dependency resolution. Conan will download all needed dependencies while CMake will use those dependencies to build your applications.

Here is a breakdown of third-party dependencies that OpenTissue *currenly* have:

- OpenTissue
> - Boost
> - TetGen
> - Triangle
> - Qhull
> - TinyXML
> - DevIL

- unit_test
> - Same as OpenTissue

- demos
> - Same as OpenTissue
> - GLUT, GLEW and OpenGL

## Using OpenTissue as Third-Party Software

OpenTissue uses CMake for generating buildsystems for Linux, MacOS and Windows. This has major benefits for OpenTissue users that use CMake for developing their own applications.
Being a header-only library, the build system generated by CMake does not build anything (unless you turn on demos or unit tests). Instead it creates a special target ```OpenTissue::headers``` that you can link agains in your applications.

Set up your workflow by following these simple steps

* Download OpenTissue: 

      git clone https://github.com/erleben/OpenTissue.git
* Create a build directory and navigate to it: 

      mkdir build && cd build
* Fetch all dependencies by running Conan: 

      conan install <path-to-opentissue> -s build_type=Debug -o *:shared=False
* Run CMake on the same build directory: 
  
      cmake <path-to-opentissue>
After the last step, new configuration, target, and version files will be created in the build directory:

      build/OpenTissueConfig.cmake
      build/OpenTissueTargets.cmake
      build/OpenTissueVersion.cmake

These files define OpenTissue's most important variables, settings and exported targets.

The foollowing lines demonstrate how an application can link and use OpenTissue as an external library.

<pre>

MyProject
|
+-- CMakeLists.txt
|
+-- src
    |
    +-- main.cpp
</pre>

CMakeLists.txt:

<pre>
project(MyProject)

set(OpenTissue_ROOT "path-to-opentissue-build-dir")
find_package(OpenTissue)

add_executable(MyProject src/main.cpp)
target_link_library(MyProject
  PRIVATE
    OpenTissue::headers
)
</pre>

Notice that we set the ```OpenTissue_ROOT``` variable to the build directory conataining ```OpenTissueConfig.cmake```. This will instruct ```find_package()``` to look there in order to search for OpenTissue. Once it finds ```OpenTissueConfig.cmake``` it will load it along with ```OpenTissueTargets.cmake``` and ```OpenTissueVersion.cmake```. This will automatically bring the ```OT::<target>``` targets which you can then use in your project to resolve OpenTissue dependencies in of the application.

The special targets ```OT::<target>``` are ```interface external targets``` and they contain references to the OpenTissue headers, flags and possibly other dependency flags that may be needed by your application.
